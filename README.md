My React Gallery App
Welcome to my React Gallery App! This project features a login page with Firebase authentication and a gallery page where you can view and search images based on tags.

Features
Login Page: The application provides a secure login page powered by Firebase Authentication. Users can sign in with their credentials to access the gallery.

Gallery Page: Once logged in, users can explore a beautiful gallery of images. Each image is tagged with keywords to make it easier to find specific images.

Error Handling: The app includes error handling to display helpful error messages to users when something goes wrong, such as invalid login credentials.

Search Functionality: To enhance user experience, a search functionality is implemented. You can search for images by entering keywords or tags, and the app will filter and display matching images.

Technologies Used
React: The front-end of the application is built using the React JavaScript library.

Firebase Authentication: Firebase is used to handle user authentication, ensuring secure login functionality.

Firebase Realtime Database: Firebase Realtime Database is used to store and retrieve image data, including tags.
